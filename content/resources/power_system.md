<p>We are studying decision-making in familial FTD kindreds from two large NIH-funded multicenter networks spanning the US and Canada. We hypothesize that early behavioral and physiological changes in FTD mutation carriers will reveal initial signs and mechanisms of impaired judgment in FTD, potentially also elucidating neural mechanisms of impaired decision-making in other neuropsychiatric disorders. Presymptomatic mutation carriers and noncarrier family members from these multicenter networks are recruited to perform tests of decision-making on a secure web-enabled platform that enables rapid and flexible data collection from participants across North America. Linking our behavioral measures to a rich dataset of cognitive and neuroimaging measures already being collected across network sites allows us to combine the strengths of traditional on-site evaluation with the flexibility and scaling advantages of newer online methods.</p>
